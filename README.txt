This is a project I completed over many hours to showcase the raw power of modern css. The animations are fast. The page is responsive,
and so too are the images. I had help from a man Jonas S, in his course on Udemy. I learned a ton, and it makes me glad to know some of the
old school ways of doing things with floats and not bootstrap.
